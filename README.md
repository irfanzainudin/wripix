# WriPix

A library for writing in pixels :)

## Usage

## Why?

This project is just a fun little project for me to learn Rust. I am planning to develop more features and include more free fonts in its library (see Plan section below).

However, I am not completely sure what is the end goal. In my mind, there are 2 possibilities:

- A stand-alone tool (possibly for mock ups)
- A component of a larger project (possibly a 2D game engine)

## Plan

A roadmap of some sort

### Features

#### High Priority

- [ ] A more efficient way to read in pixel fonts
  - An idea could be to make the glyphs using Aseprite and read .bmp files using the bmp crate
  - Another is to use a crate (check out CRATES.md)
- [ ] Multiple line writing
- [ ] Templated layouts
- [ ] Borders for the text

#### Lower Priority

- [ ] Layering the texts
- [ ] Animating (?)

### Fonts

- [ ] Mosaico
- [ ] Enchanted Sword
- [ ] graphicore
- [ ] (a graffiti font - look on Pinterest)
- [ ] Pixel Sleigh
- [ ] Pixelatus
- [ ] Gothic Pixel
- [ ] Bonefish
- [ ] Pixel Gothic
- [ ] Minecraft
- [ ] ...
